# // Get the required elements from the DOM
> In this part, we're getting references to the necessary elements from the HTML DOM using their respective id attributes. commonWordForm represents the form element, textInput represents the input field where the user enters the text, and resultElement represents the paragraph element where the result will be displayed.

```
const commonWordForm = document.getElementById('common-word-form');
const textInput = document.getElementById('text-input');
const resultElement = document.getElementById('result');
```


# // Function to find the most common word

> The findMostCommonWord function is responsible for finding the most common word. It takes an event object as a parameter because it will be used as the event listener for the form submission. The event.preventDefault() method is called to prevent the default form submission behavior, which would cause the page to refresh.

> Next, we get the text entered by the user from the textInput field. We trim the text to remove any leading or trailing whitespace, then split it into an array of words using a regular expression (/\s+/). This regular expression splits the text at one or more whitespace characters, such as spaces or tabs.

> We create an empty object called wordCounts to store the counts of each word. We iterate over each word in the words array using the forEach method. If the word already exists as a property in the wordCounts object, we increment its count. Otherwise, we set its count to 1.

> After counting the occurrences of each word, we initialize variables mostCommonWord and maxCount to keep track of the word with the highest count and its count, respectively. We iterate over each word in the wordCounts object using a for...in loop. If the count of the current word is greater than maxCount, we update mostCommonWord and maxCount with the current word and its count.

>Finally, we update the textContent of the resultElement to display the most common word and its count using template literals.

```

function findMostCommonWord(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  const text = textInput.value;
  const words = text.trim().split(/\s+/);
  const wordCounts = {};

  words.forEach(function(word) {
    if (wordCounts[word]) {
      wordCounts[word]++;
    } else {
      wordCounts[word] = 1;
    }
  });

  let mostCommonWord = '';
  let maxCount = 0;

  for (const word in wordCounts) {
    if (wordCounts[word] > maxCount) {
      mostCommonWord = word;
      maxCount = wordCounts[word];
    }
  }

  resultElement.textContent = `Most Common Word: ${mostCommonWord} (${maxCount} occurrences)`;
}


```


# // Add event listener to the form submission
> We add an event listener to the form submission using the addEventListener method. When the form is submitted, the findMostCommonWord function will be called, which triggers the process of finding the most common word.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the JavaScript part of the code. Let me know if you have any further questions!

```
// Add event listener to the form submission
commonWordForm.addEventListener('submit', findMostCommonWord);

```
